3 Observable Trends from the Heroes of Pymoli Data:

1 - Male players, far and away, make up the biggest gender demographic.

2 - And the biggest Age Demographic is 20-24 yr olds.

3 -It's not alot of big purchases.  The biggest spender only purchased 5 items for less than
$20.  Which is surprising.  I would thought there would've been some players with much higher purchase
totals.  

So I think the big take-away is that Males, 20-24yrs old are the audience to target 
and spending any and all marketing dollars to bring more of that target audience to the
game.  Always adding more new items to get people to buy is helpful too, but it doesn't seem
like people are spending lots of money and buying tons of items.  So the best path forward
for success would be continually bringing a new players in to buy their 4 or 5 items.
